# Hello World

Welcome to my personal blog. This is where I'll be sharing my journey in software engineering, leadership insights, and maybe some random thoughts about technology, entrepreneurship, sovereignty and travel. Or the other way around.

## Why a blog?

I've always believed that writing is the best way to clarify your thinking. As I navigate through different challenges in my life, I want to document them not just for others, but for my future self.

Stay tuned for more!
